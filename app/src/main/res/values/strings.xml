        Welcome to Kana<![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>SRS</font></b>]]>!
        <![CDATA[<br/>]]>Once this app has been completed, you will be able to read the kana above
        「ようこそ」 and much, much more!</string>

    <string name="writing_info">While reading is about <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>recognizing</font></b>]]>,
        writing the kana is about <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>recalling</font></b>]]>
        the image of it in your mind. This can create a <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>deeper</font></b>]]>
        connection during the learning process, and is very beneficial!
        However, we understand if your goal is not aligned with the need to write.
        So, we have created the option to <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>turn off</font></b>]]>
        all writing related stats and functions. You will be able to turn it back on at any time,
        and turning it off and on <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>will not</font></b>]]>
        reset progress.</string>

    <string name="random_font_info">This setting can be used to randomly assign a new font on every
        review item. Reading computer font compared to handwriting can be vastly different,
        as in most languages. There are many styles, so we provide the option to review with variety.

    <string name="hiragana_intro_1">Hiragana is one of the three character sets, and is one of two
        phonetic lettering systems.</string>
    <string name="hiragana_intro_2">Phonetic means the characters have no special meaning,
        but rather make up the basic sounds.</string>
    <string name="hiragana_intro_3">You will learn the basic 46 letters, with
        some additional modifications that make up the rest of the sounds.</string>
    <string name="hiragana_intro_4">Hiragana is typically
        used for grammatical patterns, as well as some words.</string>

    <string name="katakana_intro_1">Katakana is the second character set, and like hiragana, is also phonetic.</string>
    <string name="katakana_intro_2">The syllables included in hiragana and katakana are the same,
        however katakana has different usages.</string>
    <string name="katakana_intro_3">The most common is that katakana is used for foreign loan words.
    You will notice Japanese people use a lot of english sounding words, because they do! This includes
        a lot of scientific words as well.</string>
    <string name="katakana_intro_4">Katakana also looks really cool, sharp, and modern! Many companies
    may use katakana for their name, logo, or signs!</string>

    <string name="kanji_intro_1">Kanji is the final character set, and also the biggest! Unlike hiragana
        and katakana, these characters are not phonetic!</string>
    <string name="kanji_intro_2">Each character has its own meaning, and corresponds to a word and idea.
        They can be used on their own, or put together to create different words.</string>
    <string name="kanji_intro_3">Kanji originates from China, but has long since been imported into Japanese.
        Hiragana and katakana are much quicker to learn since kanji has
        thousands of characters to learn, but don\'t be overwhelmed!</string>
    <string name="kanji_intro_4">This app does not teach kanji, but will work through the kana systems.
    Bit by bit, the Japanese alphabet will be covered! Remember, it\'s not a marathon! Take your time.</string>
