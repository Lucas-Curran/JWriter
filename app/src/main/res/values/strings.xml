        writing the kana is about <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>recalling</font></b>]]>
        the image of it in your mind. This can create a <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>deeper</font></b>]]>

        However, we understand if your goal is not aligned with the need to write.
        So, we have created the option to <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>turn off</font></b>]]>
        all writing related stats and functions. You will be able to turn it back on at any time,
        and turning it off and on <![CDATA[<b><font color=#FF0000>will not</font></b>]]>

    <string name="slide3_description">Hiragana is one of the three character sets, and is one of two
        phonetic lettering systems. \n\nPhonetic means the characters have no special meaning,
        but rather make up the basic sounds. \n\nYou will learn the basic 46 letters, with
        some additional modifications that make up the rest of the sounds.\n\nHiragana is typically
        used for grammatical patterns, as well as some words.</string>
